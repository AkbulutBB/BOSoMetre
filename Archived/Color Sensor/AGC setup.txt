1.  Iterative Approach

As with the earlier AGC version, calibration remains an iterative process:

Reasonable Starting Point: Begin with a mid-range brightness value (e.g., 128 on the 0-255 PWM scale).
Analyze Readings: Take readings of your calibration clear CSF sample. Are they within the sensor's usable range? Avoid readings too close to the minimum or maximum values the sensor can output.
Adjust & Repeat: If readings are consistently too high or too low, adjust your initial brightness manually and take new readings. Repeat this process until you get readings that fall comfortably within the sensor's range.
2.  Visual Feedback (If Possible)

Observation: If your setup allows, visually observe the calibration sample while taking readings. Look for signs of the LED being too bright (washing out the sample) or too dim (very faint light transmission). Use this as a qualitative guide alongside the readings.
3.  Leveraging  AGC Automation

Initial Short Run: Allow the AGC to run for just a few cycles with an approximate initial brightness. The goal isn't perfect calibration at this stage, but to let the system get itself into a generally workable range.
Refinement: Observe the readings and whether the AGC tends to increase or decrease brightness significantly. Adjust your initial brightness based on this, and repeat the process.
Why Iteration is Necessary

While having the perfect starting LED intensity would be ideal, several factors make it difficult to know this value in advance:

Sensor Variations: Even TCS3200 sensors of the same model will have slight manufacturing differences, affecting their sensitivity.
Sample Opacity: The exact light transmission properties of your CSF samples, even "clear" ones, will vary.
AGC Interaction: The AGC's responsiveness and filter settings also play a role in how the system reacts to a given brightness.
Important Note: Even with careful initial calibration, your  targetCount value might need fine-tuning as you test with different samples or if your application environment changes.
